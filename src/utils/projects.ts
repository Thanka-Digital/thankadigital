            In an era of widespread misinformation and media polarization, it's essential for readers to understand the perspectives that shape the news
            they consume. By identifying potential biases, the app empowers users to critically assess the information,
            fostering a more balanced view of current events. This approach encourages media literacy and helps reduce the influence of echo chambers.
            Ultimately, our goal is to promote a more informed and engaged public. Hence we created a news application that highlights political biases to
            provide users with a more transparent and informed reading experience.
